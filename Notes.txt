locate test.txt ==> This will show the directory or better to say the address of test.txt in our machine

ls -la ==> This will show all the files and directories in list format.

List format will show us:
At the left most part we'll have couple of letters moving from left to right showing:
first left most letter is d or - which d is for directory and - is for file
The next 3 letters will be rwx or - for each this is for readable writeable executable if there's a - this means that for the item that specific process is not possible. These first 3 letters is for the owner of the file meaning root.
There are 2 3 letters part left everything is the same but for these the first 3 letters will be for group which root has created and the next 3 will be for all permissions meaning everyone else.

su Ali ==> Switches to Ali
su - ==> Switches to root

Important files:
/etc/passwd ==> For seeing the users on the machine (create new user by adduser Ali)
/etc/shadow ==> Passwords in hash format ==> Only root can access it or better to say sudoers ==> sudoers are kept for knowing which users can access certain files
